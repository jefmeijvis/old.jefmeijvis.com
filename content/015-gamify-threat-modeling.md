## Techorama 2023

[Techorama Antwerp](https://techorama.be/) is a yearly IT-conference that takes place in Belgium.
It hosts nearly 2000 visitors and 120 speakers from all around the world. 
With over 150 sessions and multiple workshops spread across 3 days, it's always a pleasure to attend.

Each year the conference is themed, and this edition was no different. 
A beautiful jungle theme was present throughout the entire venue.

## Cornucopia

This year I had the opportunity to give a talk about [OWASP Cornucopia](/blog/014-OWASP-cornucopia). The talk itself was a short 20 minutes lightning talk discussing the concept of gamification of threat modeling.
