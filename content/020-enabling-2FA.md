## MFA & 2FA
Multi-factor authentication, or 2-factor authentication in this cases, requires users to provide more than a single form of verification to access their accounts. In addition to entering a matching email and password combination, users must also present a mobile phone device or a biometric factor to gain entry into their environment.
Common second factors are using a SMS text message, a mobile phone authenticator app, a fingerprint scan or a face scan using Windows Hello.

Below is a quick overview on how to enable MFA for your Microsoft 365 environment.
