## What is an ISMS?
An Information Security Management System (or ISMS) comprises a structured set of policies and procedures aimed at the systematic management of an organization's sensitive data. Its primary objective is to mitigate risks and guarantee uninterrupted business operations by proactively minimizing the consequences of a security breach.
