## OWASP

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project®, or [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) for short, is a nonprofit foundation that works to improving the global landscape of cyber security. The foundation hosts many (285 at the time of writing) [projects](https://owasp.org/projects/) related to cyber security, al of which are community-led and open-source.

The foundation provides security resources, training and a vibrant community around security.
OWASP hosts [local chapters](https://owasp.org/chapters/) which are free and open for anyone to attend.
They provide a great opportunity to attend training sessions and talks, while also allowing you to expand your network. I myself attended the [Benelux OWASP chapter](https://www.owaspbenelux.eu/) in Tilburg last year.


## OWASP SAMM

The Software Assurance Maturity Model, or SAMM for short is an open-source framework to help software teams start and improve their secure software development lifecycle. 

### Structure
The model consists out of 5 different business functions.
A business function is a group of activities that are relevant to software development companies. 
Each business function has 3 security practices, which are divided into two streams.
Finally, for every security practice there are 3 defined maturity levels.

The image below gives a clear overview of all the different security practices that are defined in the SAMM model.

All the different security practices can be viewed at [https://owaspsamm.org/model/](the SAMM model overview)


### Getting started
SAMM provides a lot of guidance to get started with using the model. 
A typical approach consists of:
- Going trough the assesment
- Setting the maturity level target
- Create implementation plan
- Roll-out

Consider this only as the starting point, as OWASP SAMM is suited for continuous improvement!
The [quick start guide](https://owaspsamm.org/guidance/quick-start-guide/) provides detailed instructions on how to get started using SAMM.
