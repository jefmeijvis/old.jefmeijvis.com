<h1>About</h1>
<p>
    My name is Jef. I'm a software engineer, focusing mostly on the C# / Dotnet / Azure ecosystem. 
    I work at as a software consultant at <a rel=noreferrer href="https://www.dotnetlab.eu">DotnetLab</a>, a company focussing on Microsoft technologies.
    This blog will be used to post anything related to Dotnet development and Azure!</p>
  <p>
    Recently I've been awarded the Microsoft Certified Trainer title!
  </p>
  <h2>The website</h2>
  <p>The site was made using <a rel=noreferrer href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> and <a rel=noreferrer href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">Sveltekit</a>. 
  Originally I planned on using a headless CMS such as Strapi, but ended up with including my blogging articles in the frontend repo as well.
  While this isn't ideal, it recudes the scope of this website to a single frontend app running on a Node server. 
  It also allows me to include some custom elements inside a blogpost, if needed.</p>
  <p>Feel free to <a rel=noreferrer href="/contact">contact me!</a></p>
