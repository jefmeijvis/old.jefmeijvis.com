<h1>About</h1>
<p>
    My name is Jef. I'm a software engineer, focusing mostly on the C# / Dotnet / Azure ecosystem. 
    I work as a software consultant at <a rel=noreferrer href="https://www.dotnetlab.eu">DotnetLab</a>, a company focussing on Microsoft technologies.
    This blog will be used to post anything related to Dotnet development and Azure!</p>
  <p>
    Recently I've been awarded the Microsoft Certified Trainer title!
